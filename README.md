# Ability Hand ROS2

ROS2 Humble implementation for integrating Ability Hand [Python Wrapper](https://github.com/psyonicinc/ability-hand-api/tree/master/python) 
with ROS2.  For ROS2 Jazzy, please use the [jazzy branch](https://github.com/psyonicinc/ability-hand-ros2/tree/jazzy).

## Regular Setup

#### Install ROS2 Humble (Ubuntu 22.04)

If using Ubuntu 22.04, you can follow the [install instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html)
.  If using Ubuntu 23.04 or higher or Windows, Docker is suggested.  

It is recommended to use the included localhost only cyclonedds.xml config file.
To install cyclone dds and use the included config file run

`./cyclone_dds_install.sh`

#### Install Ability Hand Python Wrapper

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/psyonicinc/ability-hand-api/tree/master/python) 
to install the Python Ability Hand Wrapper

#### Built ROS2 Package

From ability-hand-ros2 directory build using `colcon build` and source using `source ./install/setup.bash`

## Docker Setup

Choose which nodes you wish to launch using Docker by modifying `entrypoint.sh`

### Linux

Docker installation instructions for various Linux distributions can be found
[here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Ensure you do the 
[post installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

Navigate to the Docker directory of this repo and enter the following command

`xhost + && docker compose up`


## Topics

You can receive motor feedback on the following topics:

`/ability_hand/right/feedback/velocity`  
`/ability_hand/right/feedback/position`  
`/ability_hand/right/feedback/current`  

Using the following indices  
`[index, middle, ring, pinky, thumb flexor,  thumb rotator]`

You can receive touch sensor feedback as well, with 6 touch sensors per finger
via the topic:

`/ability_hand/right/feedback/touch`  

To control the hand publish on any of the following topics:

`/ability_hand/right/target/velocity`  
`/ability_hand/right/target/position`  
`/ability_hand/right/target/current`  
`/ability_hand/right/target/duty`

using an *ah_messages/msg/Digits.msg* message, for example:

`ros2 topic pub -r 200 /ability_hand/right/target/position ah_messages/msg/Digits "{reply_mode: 0, data: [0.0, 90.0, 90.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]}"`

## Examples

To start the Ability Hand Node with an automatic write thread, use:

`colcon build && source ./install/setup.bash`  
`ros2 launch ah_ros_py ah_node.launch.py write_thread:=True`

You can change the hand's position using
`ros2 topic pub --once /ability_hand/right/target/position ah_messages/msg/Digits "{reply_mode: 0, data: [0.0, 90.0, 90.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]}"`

Since the write thread is running, you only have to publish the message once. In 
most typical cases, you will set write_thread:=False and have another ROS node 
publishing to the hand at least every 0.3 seconds / 5Hz. Ideally, you publish at 
least 200Hz for smoother control.

For example, run the hand wave node without a write thread:

`ros2 launch ah_ros_py hand_wave.launch.py`

If you enable the `js_publisher` argument in the `ah_node.launch.py` launch file
it will publish to `/joint_states_ah` which the joint state publisher in the
`urdf_launch` package subscribes to. This allows you to visualise the joint states
and URDF using:

`ros2 launch ah_ros_py hand_wave.launch.py js_publisher:=True`  
`ros2 launch urdf_launch display.launch.py`

If you would like to visualize the FSR touch sensors in RVIZ launch the FSR 
marker node.

`ros2 run ah_ros_py fsr_marker_node`
